This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```




Fixation count to all AOIs (ANOVA):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
count5aov <- apa_print(count5aov)
count5aov_table <- apa_table(
  count5aov$table
  , caption = 'Test.'
  , note = 'Test.'
)
```

Fixation count to all AOIs (descriptives):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(count5table)
```

Fixation count to face vs non-face AOIs:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(fix2plot)
```

Fixation count to face vs. non-face AOIs (ANOVA):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
count2aov <- apa_print(count2aov)
count2aov_table <- apa_table(
  count2aov$table
  , caption = 'Test.'
  , note = 'Test.'
)
```

Fixation count to face vs. non-face AOIs (descriptives):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(count2table)
```

Fixation count to all AOIs by group (ANOVA):
```{r, echo=FALSE}
count5aov2 <- apa_print(count5aov2)
count5aov2_table <- apa_table(
  count5aov2$table
  , caption = 'Test.'
  , note = 'Test.'
)
```

Fixation count to face vs non-face AOIs by group:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(fixgroupbox)
```




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
